# Introduction

Maybe you are thinking about buying a new car - Ford, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, BMW, Jaguar, or Land Rover? We built their sites to sell their cars. Do you know the colorful happy socks? Yes, we built the HappySocks webstore!

Using L'Oreal or Lancome makeup and skincare products? That's our customer! Running in PUMA shoes? Their eCommerce store was made by Scandiweb! Buying tickets at airBaltic.com or visiting THE MET museum in New York? Websites made in Scandiweb! Enjoying… Hmm… Yeah, we made an official Durex site too!

Now what? We need to optimize their stores daily, and DATA is the key here. Millions of sessions and transactions are recorded & analyzed daily to make educated decisions to help our clients EARN MORE.

We are the #1 eCommerce Agency in the world and it takes a lot to push the boundaries and stay ahead! Join us and be part of the ambitious journey!

# What is a day like for a Junior Data Analytics Engineer?

We expect you to be a real Junior - eager to absorb information and advice from mentors as a sponge, break things, try again, break and try again until you build a stable framework of knowledge around the things you are doing.
But to join successfully, you need to understand "technical language". It is expected to have:

- Basic understanding of eCommerce business concepts
- Know what is Google Analytics and how does it work
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript concepts
- Good English language skills - can write and communicate
- Humility & the wisdom to accept that you will make mistakes. But you'll learn.
- HUGE willingness and dedication to learn new things to grow professionally and personally
- You're an organized person – you will need to do research, take notes, document everything ;)

Either you've learned that in the University, or during late nights on YouTube watching tutorials, or just learned your way around it… We don't expect WORK experience, but starting knowledge is required.
Do not expect to start work in the first days or weeks. You will train, learn, get feedback and support. Training will stay with you permanently while you are at Scandiweb - we have a continuous training program, so there are small bits of education every week and month! We help everybody to build a rich and robust data analytics engineer competency framework!
